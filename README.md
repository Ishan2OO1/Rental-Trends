# Rental-Trends
Overview

In recent times, bike-sharing systems have transformed urban transportation, providing a convenient and eco-friendly alternative. Users can seamlessly rent bikes from one station and return them to another, encouraging sustainable commuting. However, predicting bike demand remains a significant challenge for businesses, often resulting in inefficiencies such as mismatched bike availability and user needs.

This project aims to address this challenge by forecasting bike rental demand using various environmental and time-based features.  A predictive model will enable bike rental businesses to better manage inventory, ensuring optimal availability and improving user satisfaction.
